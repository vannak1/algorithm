# You are given an array of integers in which every element appears twice, except for one. Find the element that only appears one time. Your solution should have a linear runtime complexity (O(n)). Try to implement it without using extra memory.
#
# Example
#
# For nums = [2, 2, 1], the output should be
# singleNumber(nums) = 1.
