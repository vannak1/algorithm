# Given an array of numbers arr, determine whether arr can be divided into two subsets for which the sum of elements in both subsets is the same.
#
# Example
#
# For arr = [3, 5, 16, 8], the output should be
# subsetSum(arr) = true.
#
# It is possible to partition this array into two subsets that have a sum of 16: [16] and [3, 5, 8].
#
# For arr = [5, 7, 1], the output should be
# subsetSum(arr) = false.
